# Forecast App

## Description

The following app provides the user the current weather, which includes an image, temperature, wind speed and humidity.

This app was made in order to see weather in multiple areas, which can also be re-populated in order to see if there are any changes. 

From creating this app, I learned how to call information using an API, and creating multiple functions and calling variable within functions.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

In order to use this app, in the search bar you would start off by typing in a city name. 

Once you click "search", you will then be shown today's weather at the top, and the next five-day forecast in the boxes below.

If you conduct more searches, your previous searches will be appended to the "Recently Searched" section. When you click on your previous searches, your previous search will reload onto the page.
